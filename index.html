        At big vpn we forword your ip address so that people have a hard time identifing and tracki g you online. basicly we take your internt trafic and sent it through our servers
       . we pride our selves in dada security that is y we encrypt your data so that nobody else can take it. once it's passed through our servers we scramblee your ip. with Your new ip you can go ahead with your browsing and nobody will be able to pin yout data to your s3lf.
       and just to restate it vpn^2 will never, has never and will steal/ store any information of yours that paasses throught our system.

        if you are reading this I know this code is bad dont judge it, it was totaly ment to reflect the crappyness of the website and not bad because I forgot most of the html and css that I once new. I also think it is a bit funny if this comment is as long as possibal so I'm just going to keepp typing for a while well actualy that would take too long so Ill stop it here. wait I think it would be funny if this was part of the website but just the same color as the back ground.
